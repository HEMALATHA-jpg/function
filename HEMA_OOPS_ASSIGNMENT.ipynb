        "\n",
        "ANS-> The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Classes and Objects:\n",
        "\n",
        "Class: A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "Object: An instance of a class. Objects are created based on the class and have their own values for the properties defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions or behaviors) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It also restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is typically done by using access specifiers (like private, public, and protected in languages like Java or C++).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Abstraction:\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction means hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. This simplifies interaction with the object, providing a clear interface and reducing complexity for the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance allows a new class (called a subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (called a superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between the parent and child classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It also enables the same method to behave differently based on the object that invokes it. This is often achieved through method overloading (same method name, different parameters) or method overriding (subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in the superclass)."
